	Hello Stevie!  Oops, that should be Rev. Marchbanks.  However, to me, you will always be Stevie Marchbanks.  So glad to see you after 30 years doing so well and with such a beautiful family.  I have such fond memories of you and my boys during the days at Truth Tabernacle.  I am attending Pastor Donald Lance's church - The Lighthouse - in Jackson, TN.  The &quot;boys&quot; are now just like you... no longer &quot;boys&quot; and are a bit scattered around the country.  I would love to hear more about your family and church, and would like to share some about the Thornsberry's with you.  If you would, please tell your mom and dad I said hello.  Hope to hear from  you soon and May God Richly Bless your church there in Porterville, as well as your family.<br />

	I need to tell on some one!! So we can all have hope and be encouraged! I was Greeting one time at church and my greet buddy and I began talking and i just started to encourage her. I told her how I feel sometimes and just tried to make all things Good, letting her know that I didn't always feel like a big smile at times, but that I knew others feel that way at times also. And it's okay, we laughed and enjoyed each others company greeting together. Next nite at altar call she came up to me and handed me a note. As I opened it, I saw a gift card for Black Bear restaurant. The note said, &quot;Thank you so much for making me feel happy at church!&quot; So the moral of the story is, make everyone feel good, Encourage someone. You never know what blessings may come. All I know is no one can afford to have drag downs, put downs, or hang ups. We've got to blow the top off of serving God and give it more than we ever have! We must stop just including God in our life, we need to give God all our life- be sold out 100%.  Instead of letting God be apart of our life, try letting God be All our life! We don't ask God for just apart of salvation! We want all of salvation! So we need to give Him all. We don't have long, so what we do we better do quickly. &quot;Well I see the bright lights shine, oh it's just about home time, I can see the Father standing at door, this old world is wilderness, I'm getting ready for deliverance, I've never been this homesick before!&quot;<br />

	I want to first and foremost give thanks and all the glory to God, He used a very good friend of mine that attends the Orosi Church to guide me, and direct me to Life Tabernacle here in Porterville,CA. I know my beginning was hard and i struggled in many areas and for me REPENTANCE was hard,but the HOLY GHOST was earned, and my baptism was a HONOR. I've visited many churches in my 28 yrs of life, but, at Life Tabernacle I was given something unique, where TRUTH is found, BELIEF is strong, and EVERYONE IS ACCEPTED. I thank everyone at the church for prayers and strong unity of support. A SPEACIAL THANKS to  Grandma Griffen, the Webb Family, The Wyatt Family, and MOST IMPORTANTLY The Marchbanks Family. God Bless and thank you <br />
